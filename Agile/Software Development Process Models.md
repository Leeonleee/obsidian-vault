# Why Software Engineering?
We need to build high quality software systems under resource constraints
## Social
- Satisfy user needs
	- e.g. functional, reliable, trustworthy
- Impact on people's lives
	- e.g. software failure, data protection
## Economical
- Reduce costs; open up new opportunities
- Average cost of IT development:
	- ~$2.3m: large companies
	- ~$1.4m: medium companies
	- ~$434k: small companies
## Time to Market
- Deliver software on time
# What is Software Engineering?
"*An engineering discipline that is concerned with all aspects of software production, from the early states of system specification through to maintaining it after it has gone into use*"
- Not just programming/coding
- Theories, methods, tools for cost-effective software production
- Technical process, project management, development of tools, methods to support software production
- System engineering (hardware & software)
	- software often dominates costs
# Software Process
## Software Development Process
- Set of activities required to develop a software
- Activities to be done, and in what order
- Lifecycle for a software development project
- Processes, a set of tools, definitions of the artefacts, etc

There are many software development processes, but all include common activities
- Specification (software/system requirements)
- Design and implementation
- Validation (testing)
- Evolution
## Models
### Waterfall Model
- Development process activities as process phases

| Development Activities                                              | Teams                                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Divide the work into stages                                         | A separate team of specialists for each stage                   |
| At each stage, the work is passed from one team to another          | Some coordination is required for the handoff using "documents" |
| At the end of all stages, you have a software product ready to ship | As each team finishes, they are assigned to a new product       |

#### Phases
- Requirements definition
	- Requirements document
- System and software design
	- Design document based on requirements document
- Implementation and unit testing
	- Code and test it for system components (using design document)
- Integration and system testing
	- Software components are integrated and the resulting system is tested
- Operation and maintenance
---
- Intensive documenting and planning
- Easy to understand and implement
- Identified deliverables and milestones
- Discovering issues in earlier phases should lead to returning to an earlier phase
#### Issues
- Difficult to make changes after the process is underway
- Inflexible partitioning of the project into distinct stages makes it hard to respond to changing customer requirements
- Mostly used for long systems engineering projects where a system is developed at several sites

### Spiral Model
- Incremental development, risk driven
### Agile Model
- Iterative incremental process for rapid software development
### Rational Unified Process (RUP/UP)
- Brings together elements of different models
- Phases of the model in timer, process activities, good practises
- Uses iterative and risk-driver approach to develop object-oriented software systems
- Iterative incremental development
- Iterative evolutionary development


# Agile Process
## Principles
1. Highest priority is to **satisfy the customer** through **early** and **continuous delivery of valuable software**
2. **Welcome changing requirements**, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage
3. **Deliver working software frequently**, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with preference to the shorter timescale
4. Business people and developers must **work together daily** throughout the project
5. Build projects around **motivated individuals**. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done
6. The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is **face-to-face conversation** 
7. **Working software** is the primary measure of progress

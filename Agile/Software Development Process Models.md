# Why Software Engineering?
We need to build high quality software systems under resource constraints
## Social
- Satisfy user needs
	- e.g. functional, reliable, trustworthy
- Impact on people's lives
	- e.g. software failure, data protection
## Economical
- Reduce costs; open up new opportunities
- Average cost of IT development:
	- ~$2.3m: large companies
	- ~$1.4m: medium companies
	- ~$434k: small companies
## Time to Market
- Deliver software on time
# What is Software Engineering?
"*An engineering discipline that is concerned with all aspects of software production, from the early states of system specification through to maintaining it after it has gone into use*"
- Not just programming/coding
- Theories, methods, tools for cost-effective software production
- Technical process, project management, development of tools, methods to support software production
- System engineering (hardware & software)
	- software often dominates costs
# Software Process
## Software Development Process
- Set of activities required to develop a software
- Activities to be done, and in what order
- Lifecycle for a software development project
- Processes, a set of tools, definitions of the artefacts, etc

There are many software development processes, but all include common activities
- Specification (software/system requirements)
- Design and implementation
- Validation (testing)
- Evolution
## Models
### Waterfall Model
- Development process activities as process phases
### Spiral Model
- Incremental development, risk driven
### Agile Model
- Iterative incremental process for rapid software development
### Rational Unified Process (RUP/UP)
- Brings together elements of different models
- Phases of the model in timer, process activities, good practises

# Binary Trees
## Tree Terminology
- **Root:** node without parent
- **Internal node:** node with at least one child
- **External/Leaf node:** node without children

- **Ancestors:** parent, grandparent, great-grandparent etc
- **Descendants:** child, grandchild, great-grandchild etc
- **Siblings:** 2 nodes with the same parent

- **Depth:** number of ancestors not including itself
- **Level:** set of nodes within given depth
- **Height:** maximum depth

- **Subtree:** tree made up of some node and its descendant
- **Edge:** pair of nodes such that one is the parent of the other (line between 2 nodes)
- **Path:** sequence of nodes such that 2 consecutive nodes in the sequence have an edge

- **Complete Binary Tree:** a binary tree in which every level except the last is filled, and nodes in the last level are filled from left to right
- **Balanced Binary Tree:** a binary tree in which the left and right subtrees of every node differ in height by at most 1

## Operations & Time Complexity

| Operation | Time Complexity  | Notes |
| --------- | ---------------- | ----- |
| access    | $O(log\space n)$ |       |
| search    | $O(log\space n)$ |       |
| insert    | $O(log\space n)$ |       |
| remove    | $O(log\space n)$                 |       |

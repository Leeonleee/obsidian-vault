# What is an Automata?
It's like a symbol processing program that:
- takes a *string* as input
- can only use variables with *finite* domains
	- state taking finitely many variables
- reads the input string character by character
- can test for end of input
- must decide to *accept* or *reject* the input string

## Graphical Representation of Automata
- Directed edge-labeled graph
	- Vertices represent states
	- Labeled edges $q\xrightarrow a q'$ represents transitions between states
	- The **start** state is marked with an incoming arrow
	- The **final** states are marked with an extra circle

# Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA)
A deterministic finite automaton (DFA) $M$ consists of 5 items
$$(Q,\Sigma,\delta,q_0,F)$$

where:
1. $Q$ is a finite set of **states**
2. $\Sigma$ is the **alphabet** (input alphabet)
3. $\delta:Q\times\Sigma\rightarrow Q$ is the **transition function**
	- if $\delta(q,a)=q'$ we write $q\xrightarrow a q'$ , called a **transition**
4. $q_0\in Q$ is the **start state** (initial state)
5. $F\subseteq Q$ is the set of **final states** (accepting states)

## Languages Recognised by $M$
- The automaton accepts the strings that label a path from the start state to a final state
- The **language recognised by** $\textbf{M}$ (the language of $M$) written $L(M)$ is the set of strings the automaton accepts
### Math definition
- A **run** (aka computation) of $M$ on $w=w_1w_2\cdots w_n$ is a sequence of transitions $q_0\xrightarrow w_1 q_1\xrightarrow w_2 q_2\xrightarrow w_3\cdots\xrightarrow {w_n} q_n$ where $q_0$ is the starting state
- The run is **accepting** if $q_n\in F$
- If $w$ has an accepting run, then we say $M$ **accepts** $w$
- The set $L(M) = \lbrace w\in\Sigma^*:M\text{ accepts } w\rbrace$ is the **language recognised by** $\textbf M$ ( the language of $M$)

## Regular Languages
- A language $L\subseteq\Sigma^*$ is called **regular** if $L = L(M)$ for some DFA $M$
	- $M$ must accept all strings in $L$ and reject all strings (in $\Sigma^*$) that are not in $L$

## Designing Automata Tips
- Build automata out of other automata using closure properties of regular languages
- If you have DFA for $L_1,L_2$ then you can get DFA for
	1. $\Sigma^*\backslash L_1$ 
	2. $L_1\cup L_2$
	3. $L_1L_2$
	4. $(L_1)^*$

### Regular Languages Closed Under Complementation
**Theorem**
- If $L$ is regular, then $\Sigma^*\backslash L$ is regular
**Idea**
- Swap final and non-final states in a DFA for $L$
	- Given DFA $M=(Q,\Sigma,\delta,q_0,F)$ recognising $L$
	- We build a DFA $M'$ recognising $\Sigma^*\backslash L$ as follows:
		- Define $M'=(Q,\Sigma,\delta,q_0,F')$ where $F'=Q\backslash F$
## Important Questions about DFA
1. **Membership problem**
	- Input: DFA $M$, string $w$
	- Output: decide if $w\in L(M)$
2. **Non-emptiness problem**
	- Input: DFA $M$
	- Output: decide if $L(M)\neq\emptyset$
3. **Equivalence problem**
	- Input: DFAs $M_1,M_2$
	- Output: decide if $L(M_1)=L(M_2)$
### Membership problem
```
def membership(M,w):
state = q_0
while not end_of_input(w):
	x = get_char(w)
	state = Î´(state,x)
if state in F:
	return "Yes" # M accepts x
else:
	return "No" # M does not accept x
```

# Nondeterministic Finite Automata
- Nondeterminism: situations where the next state of a computation is not uniquely determined by the current state and current input
- A **nondeterministic finite automaton (NFA)** is like a DFA, except that states can have *zero*, *one*, or *more* outgoing transitions on the same input symbol
- A string is *accepted by an NFA* if it labels some path from the start state to a final state
- In an NFA, a string can label 0, 1, or more paths
---
- NFAs are good for specifying languages in the form "the string has $x$ as a substring"

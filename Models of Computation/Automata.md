# What is an Automata?
It's like a symbol processing program that:
- takes a *string* as input
- can only use variables with *finite* domains
	- state taking finitely many variables
- reads the input string character by character
- can test for end of input
- must decide to *accept* or *reject* the input string

## Graphical Representation of Automata
- Directed edge-labeled graph
	- Vertices represent states
	- Labeled edges $q->^{a}q$

# Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA)

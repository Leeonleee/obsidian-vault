# What counts as a step?
## Pseudocode
- Assignments: `a=42`
- Comaprisions: `i<j`
- Boolean formulas: `(p && q) && q`
- Mathematical operations: `a = 42x + y`

## Turing Machine
- A single transition counts as a step

# Time Complexity
$$f(n)=\text{the largest number of steps taken by the algorithm/TM on any input of length }n$$

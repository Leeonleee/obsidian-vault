# Normal Forms
- An object can have more than one representation
- A norma form is a standard representation of objects
- e.g.
	- Objects = formulas in logic (Disjunctive Normal Form)
	- Objects = relational databases (Boyce-Codd Normal Form)
	- Objects = context-free languages (Chomsky Normal Form)
# Chomsky Normal Form
A grammar is in CNF if every rule is in one of these forms:
1. $A\rightarrow BC$ $(A, B, C$ are any variables, except that neither $B$ nor $C$ is the start variable $)$
2. $A\rightarrow a(A$ is any variable and $a$ is a terminal$)$

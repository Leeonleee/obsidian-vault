# Limitations of Regular Expressions
- Can't handle arbitrary nesting (), (()), etc
- The language of balanced parentheses is not regular

# Context Free Grammars
- Naturally describe the hierarchical structure of most programming languages
- A **grammar** is a set of rules which describes a language
	- The rules are used to **generate (derive)** strings by rewriting
	- The rules can be thought of as a recursive description of the set of strings
## Example
$$S\rightarrow aSb$$
$$S\rightarrow T$$
$$T\rightarrow c$$
- A grammar is made up of
	- **Variables** $S,T$
	- **Terminals (input symbols):** $a,b,c$
	- **Rules:** 3 in this example
	- **Start Variable:** $S$
- The arrow $\rightarrow$ can be read as "produced" or "rewrites to"
- To generate/derive a string:
	1. Write the start variable
	2. Repeat the following until no variables are written down:
		1. Pick a variable $X$ that is written down
		2. Pick a rule $X\rightarrow\dots$
		3. Replace $X$ with the right-hand side of that rule
	3. The string that remains is generated by the grammar

Turing machines are fairly robust
- variations and extensions of the basic model do not change the languages that can be recognised
- Call our Turing machines *basic TMs*
	- Deterministic
	- Single doubly-infinite tape
	- Can move left, right or stay
- 2 machines are **equivalent** if they recognise the same language

# Must move TMs
- Basic TMs can move left, right or stay put in one step

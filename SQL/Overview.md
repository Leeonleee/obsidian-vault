# Terminology
## Data
Facts that can be recorded
- Important for users
- Persistent (unchanging)
## Database
A collection of data
- Usually large
- Usually contains all data needed to operate an organisation
## Database Management System (DBMS)
Software package designed to store and manage databases
- Allows shared access from many programs
# Importance of Data
- Day to day operation of an organisation relies on accurate data
- Long term planning in an organisation relies on accurate data
- Data is a major asset for an organisation
# Importance of a Database
- It is an asset
	- Historical data can guide enterprise strategy
	- It's of interest to other enterprises
- State of the database mirrors the state of the enterprise
# How to Store and Use Data
- Write many application programs which all use a shared collection of data, and that data is stored in a DBMS
- In large organisations, the DBMS is usually commercial
	- Oracle, MS SQLServer, IBM DB2, etc
- Smaller organisations or non critical parts of large organisations often use open source systems
	- PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc
	- Also really huge data such as Facebook's data on likes etc
- Users run application programs which access the data through the DBMS
	- Programs get the DBMS to retrieve data and return it to the application
	- Programs also can get the DBMS to update data based on user input
# Managing the Data
- Typically, data management is divided to achieve the goals:
	- High-level goals ("policy") set by organisational leaders
	- Settings, processes, etc ("mechanisms") determined by technical people
## Data Management Concerns
- Deciding what data to hold and remove
- Ensuring accuracy of the data
- Ensuring proper use of the data
- Ensuring efficient use of the data
## Data Management Decisions
- Performance users get, and the security of the whole system affects the way data is stored and the system configuration settings
